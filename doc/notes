XM - All-in-One

PM - Need config file for SQL (Enter License)
   --> generated file to install SQL Server -> install silently with config -> Apply DDL scripts (creates instance, schema)
   --> Need logs from SQL Install
   SQL INSTALLED
   --> Install LR (Wizard) (Chris capturing registry)
   --> Executable calls other executables (all in folder) Separate Config than SQL. Optional App. Main EXE is a wizard. However others are silent so we might be able to leverage that
   --> Baselined file (Reg and C capture)
   --> Log files might have completion times (flags are in there)
   --> Get install logs afterwards
   --> Web Services Configuration Manager (UI Wizard) (There is a Backup to file option, JSON, can be ERB templated)

   --> Each Component Service/config/.ini (Usually, DBServer= Password=)
   --> Enable and Start Services [At End]
   --> Services Start and Config gets pulled in
       (Possible database export / import)
       -> Run differential SQL
       -> Give KB files
       -> KB Import Wizard
       -> Permissions' sets to be driven by SQL
       -> LR-PM5400 Series (HW model -->)
       -> Go to Console and Add the other systems
       -> Everything on console is an entry in DB
    --> Seed data

DX -> DO FIRST!!!! fix this file
   -> Linux post-OS config
   -> Static Hosts file all IP
   -> RPM hostname + IP flags
   -> No yum on it (possibly clone only....)
   -> DX config -> Writes on YAML config -> Changes IP ->
   -> restart services -> /usr/local/lr/conf - carpenter.yaml
   -> user lr
   -> tools/stop and start all services
   -> ELK stack w/wrappers
   -> DONE
   -> Back to PM ^
   -> Force NTP refresh to DC!

DP -> Same Wizard -> Select DP -> Invoke the other EXEs
   -> Configure .ini -> DBHost and Password change

AIE -> Same Wizard -> Select DP -> Invoke the other EXEs
   -> Configure .ini -> DBHost and Password change

Start Services: -> PM first -> Job Manager (lrjobmgr)  - Alert and Monitor (scarm)
                   AEI      -> AI (lraieengine ) + comm (LRAEIComMgr)
                   DP       -> Mediator service (Bug) (Update SQL script)

Agent - silent install
